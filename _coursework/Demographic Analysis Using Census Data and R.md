<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<br>
Baltimore City has undergone significant population changes in recent years, with some neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth while others have seen a decline. This project aims to analyze population changes over time in Baltimore City per census tract. I examined population changes of Baltimore Cities census tracts, then selected a census tract based on population change and the number of bus stops in that tract, and analyzed the spatial distribution of bus stops in that census tract using a F test in R, which confirmed that the bus stops in that tract were not clustered.
