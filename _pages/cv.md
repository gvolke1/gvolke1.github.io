    <h2>Blackwater Environmental Group: 2023 - 2024</h2>
  
    <h3>Bay Crossing Study</h3>
            <p>The Chesapeake Bay Crossing Study: Tier 2 NEPA (Tier 2 Study) is a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) study that will analyze alternatives to provide congestion relief and improve travel reliability, mobility and safety across the Chesapeake Bay. I managed community engagement efforts for the Bay Crossing Study including coordinating efforts for public engagement at the Centreville Senior Summit, fostering public participation and feedback. I researched demographic data for each Census Tract and Block Group within the study area, ensuring comprehensive insights into community needs, noting preferences for construction and feedback for the project. After engaging in public feedback efforts by placing signage with key information about the project at local community centers, I organized and meticulously cleaned bridge survey respondent data to facilitate accurate analysis and decision-making. For our documentation and progress reports, I developed interactive maps showing survey results from respondents in the study area using ArcGIS Online. After presenting findings, I worked to help guide data-driven discussions and strategic planning.</p>
