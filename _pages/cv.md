    <h3>Bay Crossing Study</h3>
     <div class="project-image">
            <img src="https://www.baycrossingstudy.com/images/template/BCS_Project_Map.jpg" alt="Bay Crossing Study Project Map">
            <p>The Chesapeake Bay Crossing Study: Tier 2 NEPA (Tier 2 Study) is a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) study that will analyze alternatives to provide congestion relief and improve travel reliability, mobility and safety across the Chesapeake Bay. I managed community engagement efforts for the Bay Crossing Study including coordinating public engagement at the Centreville Senior Summit, fostering public participation and feedback. I researched demographic data for each Census Tract and Block Group within the study area, ensuring comprehensive insights into community needs, noting preferences for construction and feedback for the project. After engaging in public feedback efforts by placing signage with key information about the project at local community centers, I organized and meticulously cleaned bridge survey respondent data to facilitate accurate analysis and decision-making. For our documentation and progress reports, I developed interactive maps showing survey results from respondents in the study area using ArcGIS Online. After presenting findings, I worked to help guide data-driven discussions and strategic planning.</p>
       

    <h3>M-NCPPC Safe Streets for All (SS4A)</h3>
    <p> Montgomery Parks, part of The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), received $7.5 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All (SS4A) grant program. The money was used to facilitate safe access to parks, trails, and recreation facilities in the county through 2026. The SS4A program funds regional, local, and Tribal initiatives to prevent roadway deaths and serious injuries. The SS4A grant money was applied to three major parks and trails in the county: Sligo Creek Stream Valley Park and trail, Matthew Henson State Park and trail, and Wheaton Regional Park. All these sites are adjacent to locations where 14 pedestrian and bicyclist deaths occurred between 2015 – 2019. The locations are all in historically disadvantaged communities. The parks department deployed four strategies to improve safety at the access points, including, developing safe trail connections to neighborhood, providing safe crossings for people walking, biking and driving through intersections, and creating separated spaces for all users of the transportation network in dense multimodal areas. For this project, I conducted detailed desktop reviews of natural and environmental resources across 23 project areas, enhancing pedestrian safety and accessibility to key community access points to Sligo Creek Park, Wheaton Regional Park, and Matthew Henson Trail. I evaluated natural and environmental resources using GIS to ensure compliance with environmental regulations such as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Section 4(f), including: 
    <ul>
    <li>sensitive species</li>
    <li>forests</li>
    <li>100-year floodplains</li>
    <li>waterways</li>
    <li>National Register of Historic Places Properties in Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act</li>
    <li>Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties</li>
    <li>Maryland Historic Trust Preservation Easements</li>
    <li>Wetlands</li>
    <li>Protected Lands</li>
    <li>Department of Natural Resources (DNR) easements</li>
    </ul> I created mapping for the project areas using ArcGIS Pro and drafted the Categorical Exclusion (CE) to submit to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) describing project scope, impact and environmental and natural resources in the project area. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) defines categorical exclusions (CEs) as a category of actions that a Federal agency has determined normally does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. I coordinated with Maryland Historical Trust (MHT), Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife & Heritage Service, ensuring comprehensive project alignment with government agencies assessment of the project impacts.</p>

    <h3>MDOT SHA Grants Program - Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) and Recreational Trails Program</h3>
    <p>Played a pivotal role in the Recreational Trails Program, conducting rigorous bridge and trail inspections across diverse terrains. Applied field expertise to identify and address critical issues such as overgrowth, water ponding, and structural integrity, safeguarding public safety and infrastructure longevity. Ensured compliance with project specifications and regulatory standards, contributing to seamless project execution. Supported Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) State Highway Administration (SHA) in managing <a href="https://www.roads.maryland.gov/Pages/TAP.aspx" target="_blank">Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP)</a> grants, reviewing invoices, and coordinating with project sponsors to ensure efficient resource allocation and project progress tracking.</p>


    <h3>Programmatic Categorical Exclusions (PCEs) and Minor PCEs for State Highway Administration (SHA) Road and Bridge Projects in Districts 3, 4 & 6</h3>
    <p>Oversaw Programmatic Categorical Exclusions (PCEs) for SHA road maintenance and bridge improvement projects across Districts 3, 4, and 6, encompassing diverse geographic areas including Montgomery, Prince George's, Baltimore, Harford, Garrett, Allegany, and Washington Counties. Collaborated closely with US Fish & Wildlife Service, utilizing advanced screening tools to assess environmental impacts on endangered species and critical habitats. Generated comprehensive shapefiles and GIS data to evaluate project areas for natural and cultural resources, scenic byways, and geological considerations. Coordinated extensively with Maryland Department of Natural Resources to ensure project alignment with state conservation objectives.</p>

    <h3>I-81 at Showalter Rd Categorical Exclusion</h3>
    <p>Developed a robust Categorical Exclusion (CE) for the I-81 corridor expansion at Showalter Rd, a critical freight transportation artery in the US. Conducted thorough demographic analysis using Environmental Justice (EJ) Screening tools to identify and mitigate potential impacts on vulnerable populations within the project vicinity. Collaborated closely with stakeholders to draft comprehensive CE documents, outlining project background, impact assessments, and mitigation strategies. Assisted in public consultation processes, fostering community engagement and ensuring project transparency and accountability.</p>

    <h3>Glenville Rd Over Mill Brook Bridge Replacement</h3>
    <p>Led the preparation of a detailed Categorical Exclusion (CE) for the replacement of Glenville Rd over Mill Brook bridge. Conducted meticulous historical research and structural analysis, reviewing annual traffic volume and structural condition reports. Identified critical issues such as deteriorating wing walls and structural failures, devising effective mitigation strategies. Developed a purpose and need statement aligned with project objectives and community needs. Coordinated closely with local authorities to address seasonal restrictions and minimize disruptions to local communities reliant on the bridge for accessibility and mobility.</p>
