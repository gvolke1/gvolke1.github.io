    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <h2>Bay Crossing Study Work</h2>
    <p>Led community engagement efforts for the new Bay Crossing including the Centreville Senior Summit, fostering public participation and feedback essential for project success. I managed demographic data collection for each Census Tract and Block Group within the study area, ensuring comprehensive insights into community needs and noting preferences and feedback for the project. I organized and meticulously cleaned bridge survey respondent data to facilitate accurate analysis and decision-making. For our documentation and progress reports, I Ddeveloped interactive maps showing survey results using ArcGIS Online. After presenting findings to senior stakeholders, my work helped guide data-driven discussions and strategic planning.</p>

    <h2>M-NCPPC Safe Streets for All (SS4A)</h2>
    <p>Conducted detailed desktop reviews of natural and environmental resources across 23 project areas, enhancing pedestrian safety and accessibility to key community landmarks including Sligo Creek Park, Wheaton Regional Park, and Matthew Henson Trail. Evaluated sensitive ecological features such as S3PA species, forests, floodplains, and waterways, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Facilitated extensive mapping and documentation efforts to support Categorical Exclusion processes. Collaborated effectively with Maryland Historical Trust for Section 106 responses and Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife & Heritage Service, ensuring comprehensive project alignment with conservation goals.</p>

    <h2>MDOT SHA Grants Program - Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) and Recreational Trails Program</h2>
    <p>Played a pivotal role in the Recreational Trails Program, conducting rigorous bridge and trail inspections across diverse terrains. Applied field expertise to identify and address critical issues such as overgrowth, water ponding, and structural integrity, safeguarding public safety and infrastructure longevity. Ensured compliance with project specifications and regulatory standards, contributing to seamless project execution. Supported Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) State Highway Administration (SHA) in managing Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) grants, reviewing invoices, and coordinating with project sponsors to ensure efficient resource allocation and project progress tracking.</p>

    <h2>Programmatic Categorical Exclusions (PCEs) and Minor PCEs for State Highway Administration (SHA) Road and Bridge Projects in Districts 3, 4 & 6</h2>
    <p>Oversaw Programmatic Categorical Exclusions (PCEs) for SHA road maintenance and bridge improvement projects across Districts 3, 4, and 6, encompassing diverse geographic areas including Montgomery, Prince George's, Baltimore, Harford, Garrett, Allegany, and Washington Counties. Collaborated closely with US Fish & Wildlife Service, utilizing advanced screening tools to assess environmental impacts on endangered species and critical habitats. Generated comprehensive shapefiles and GIS data to evaluate project areas for natural and cultural resources, scenic byways, and geological considerations. Coordinated extensively with Maryland Department of Natural Resources to ensure project alignment with state conservation objectives.</p>

    <h2>I-81 at Showalter Rd Categorical Exclusion</h2>
    <p>Developed a robust Categorical Exclusion (CE) for the I-81 corridor expansion at Showalter Rd, a critical freight transportation artery in the US. Conducted thorough demographic analysis using Environmental Justice (EJ) Screening tools to identify and mitigate potential impacts on vulnerable populations within the project vicinity. Collaborated closely with stakeholders to draft comprehensive CE documents, outlining project background, impact assessments, and mitigation strategies. Assisted in public consultation processes, fostering community engagement and ensuring project transparency and accountability.</p>

    <h2>Glenville Rd Over Mill Brook Bridge Replacement</h2>
    <p>Led the preparation of a detailed Categorical Exclusion (CE) for the replacement of Glenville Rd over Mill Brook bridge. Conducted meticulous historical research and structural analysis, reviewing annual traffic volume and structural condition reports. Identified critical issues such as deteriorating wing walls and structural failures, devising effective mitigation strategies. Developed a purpose and need statement aligned with project objectives and community needs. Coordinated closely with local authorities to address seasonal restrictions and minimize disruptions to local communities reliant on the bridge for accessibility and mobility.</p>
