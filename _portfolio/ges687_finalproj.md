<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<br>
Baltimore City has undergone significant population changes in recent years, with some neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth while others have seen a decline. This project aims to analyze population changes over time in Baltimore City per census tract. I examined population changes of Baltimore Cities census tracts, then selected a census tract based on population change and its correlation with bus stops in Baltimore City, and analyzed the spatial distribution of bus stops in that census tract compared to the rest of the city.
